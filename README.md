# Linear-Regression
In this project, we predict the price of a laptop using simple and multiple linear regression. We use features like RAM and Storage to estimate the price. This project teaches how to split data, train a regression model, evaluate its accuracy, and visualize the predictions using Python and scikit-learn.
